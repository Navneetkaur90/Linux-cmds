## User Authorization for Using `sudo`
Authorization rules for `sudo` are stored in:
* `/etc/sudoers` file and `/etc/sudoers.d/` directory 
*  Use the `visudo` command to safely edit the `/etc/sudoers` file.

## `sudo` Command Options
* **`sudo -s`**: Starts a new shell with the current user's environment but with root privileges. You remain as your original user but with elevated permissions within that shell.

* **`sudo -u <username>`**: Runs the command as the specified user but this does **not** simulate a full login shell for the target user.

* **`sudo -i`**: Starts a **full login shell** as the target user (by default, root).
    * `-i` stands for "login shell".
    * This simulates the environment the target user would have if they logged in directly.
    * It sets environment variables like `$HOME` and `$PATH` according to the target user's profile.
